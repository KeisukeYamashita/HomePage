        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p class="right-content">　The purpose of this dormitory is to contribute to the achievement of educational goals by providing convenience to students in
          their studies and fostering their personal development.<br>
          　The selection of applicants to the dormitory will be made in accordance with the above objectives.<br>　Therefore, the necessity of accommodations for
          study will be reviewed by the selection committee, but
          <span style="font-weight: bold">students from the suburbs will also be accepted ,depending on the capacity and willingness to study.</span>
        </p>
      </div>

        <h4>Role as educational dormitory</h4>
        <h5>ⅰ Human development</h5>
        <div class="left-content">
          <p>　Many students, from first-year students to majors, live in the same dormitory.If you are a freshman, you will have four grades of seniors. When
            you enter the fifth grade, you will have four grades of juniors, and you will be able to build relationships with both seniors and juniors.<br>
            　By living in such an environment, students learn to cooperate with other students in the dormitory, to be responsible for their dormitory and
            school life, to follow the rules of the dormitory, the university, and society, and to be considerate of others. These skills will be very useful
            when they enter the world of work.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>ⅱ Training in greetings</h5>
        <div class="left-content">
          <p>　You will be able to greet people, speak clearly, and act positively, which is difficult for ordinary people to do. You will be able to greet
            people, speak clearly, and act positively. Even when they leave the dormitory, they will be able to acquire the habit of doing these things
            properly.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>ⅲ Ideal for studying and club activities</h5>
        <div class="left-content">
          <p>　In the dormitory, students can directly ask their seniors and classmates what they do not understand in their studies. Because of this, the
            students in the dormitory get good grades on average.<br>
            　Many of our students go on to universities and majors.<br>
            　In addition, since the commute to school is extremely short, only about 5 minutes, students can use this time for club activities and make
            effective use of their time.</p>

    <h4>Status of Takajo Dormitory</h4>
    <div class="content">
      <p>　The dormitory has a capacity of 120 students in the men's dormitory and 31 students in the women's dormitory, for a total of 151 students. Some of
        these students are international students.<br>
        　The school dormitory has a dormitory students' association made up of all the dormitory students, and this organization voluntarily manages specific
        matters of daily life
        under the guidance of the school.<br>
        　There are a lot of rules and regulations for group living in the dormitory, and we encourage all residents to follow them. We also plan and carry out
        annual events for fellowship and interaction, and if there is anything that needs to be improved in our own lives, we discuss it together and make
        requests.<br>
        　The Dormitory Student Association is a small organization, but it has a board of directors and various subcommittees, and many dormitory students
        participate in some way to make the dormitory a fun and safe place to live.<br>
        　In addition, first-year students are assigned a resident advisor to provide guidance and counseling.</p>
